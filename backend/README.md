Backend (demo) for Library Management System

This folder contains a static JSON file that simulates the backend API for the assignment.

Files:
- sample-api-response.json : An array of student loan objects.

How to test:
1. Open frontend/index.html in a browser. If fetch is blocked by file:// CORS, run a local static server:
   - Using Node: `npx http-server . -p 8080`
   - Then open: http://localhost:8080/frontend/index.html
2. Enter Student ID CS137 to see sample record.
